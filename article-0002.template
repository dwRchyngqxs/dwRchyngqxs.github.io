	<b>If you were non-binary, which you aren't, what would be your non-binary gender?</b>
	<small><details onclick="checksumm(this)">
	<summary>Why am I being asked this question?</summary>
	C'mon non-binary is the N in "LGBTQIA+", how could this quiz not mention it?
	To give you some help with this question let's start from the beginning.

	53x. Biological sex is a human category put on pluricellular organisms with two different size of gametes.
	It is not the only reproduction system observable in nature, and organisms are not necessarily exclusively of one sex for their whole lifetime.
	Now, humans that are of one biological sex tend to not be (or become) the other sex, even though there has been a documented case of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.1800690517">sequential or simultaneous hermaphroditism</a>.
	This might not hold true depending on scientific progress.
	Let's keep exceedingly rare cases and speculation on future sex change technology aside.
	Humans can be(come) of no biological sex (non gamete producing) through injuries or at the other end of possibilies a normal process called menopause.
	The other way is usually part of puberty.

	Humans extend biological sex to include individuals that used to be or are expected to become of one biological sex.
	These extended biological sexes are correlated with quantifiable traits such as sex organs, shape of some chromosomes, hormone levels, or facial hair among many other.
	The correlation is, mind you, not perfect, and different set of traits can be present depending on the individuals.
	Some individuals known as intersex show traits of both or none of the sexes.
	The externally visible statistical traits are what makes up sexual dimorphism (the statistical difference between individuals of two different sexes).
	In practise we use (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex_medical_interventions">and unfortunately also enforce</a>) some of these traits to determine the sex of individuals.
	Most of these traits have co-evolved with sex-specific roles that benefit from them.
	Although not all sex-specific roles are of that nature, because most are cultural and cultural change rate is faster than evolutionary body selection.
	That is not to say that there are natural roles that individuals of one sex should take on, but on the opposite that history showed us that there is no reason for these roles to be intrinsically tied to sex.
	This is where the notion of genders is defined.
	Gender is all the empirical cultural differences that are statistically observable between individuals of differently identified sexes.

	Gendered roles are not the only component of gender as there are other kind of cultural expectations such as behaviourial or appearence.
	All these components and the external physical traits are what is used to infer an individual sex.
	Then people tend to extend that to inference to gender and impose associated cultural expectations.
	Gendered expectations play a big part in discriminations and particularly sexism so you should be able to identify them.
	This identification should be performed critically as denying their existence is not helpful.
	Here is an example: Assume there are objects to move, the gendered expectation is that male identified individuals should perform this task.
	This is a gendered expectation as males are indeed on average stronger than females, but the most important factor in physical strength is exercise and to a way lesser extent testosterone level (which is a secondary sex caracteristic).
	Here sex doesn't matter because what is really asked is for the stronger people to take on the task.
	A stronger female should take part in the task, and a weaker male could abstain.
	Physically impaired people should abstain no matter their sex.
	The fact that in this example a female took on a masculine role and a male abstained from it doesn't make the female less feminine nor the male less masculine nor the physically impaired genderless.
	Gender is descriptive, not prescriptive, you do not fail gender, you make it.

	This last sentence and the whole description of gender seem to indicate that there are only two genders of which all (non intersex) individual fall into.
	But it is a mistake to think so, because gender are statistical empirical categories meaning that an individual can significantly differ from the statistic normality in many ways.
	Therefore the step where people extend the sex inference to gender and impose associated cultural expectations is wrong and also part of discrimination (can we call that genderism?).
	One of the ways to not conform is to chose to refuse the gender associated with the sex an individual is expected to become or used to be and embrace the cultural expectations of another gender.
	This is referred to as the individual being transgender.
	Another way is to not conform exclusively to a gender associated with a sex.
	This is what non binarity and non binary genders are.

	a set of expectations, like how to act, talk, dress, feel emotion, and interact with other people
	we don’t have to conform.
	Nonbinary genders, like genderfluid, genderqueer, polygender, bigender, and many othersoThere
	are many aspects of someone’s gender:

	Gender Expression: The way in which people present or express their gender, including physical
	appearance, clothing, hairstyles, and behavior. People can exert a certain degree of control
	over their gender expression depending on their resources and environment.

	Gender Identity: Our personal sense of what our own gender is. 

	Perceived Gender: How the world sees and understands your gender.
	[nonbinary wiki: https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Main_Page]
	Nonbinary is a term that refers to people whose gender is not completely and exclusively male or
	female. They can identify with not having gender at all, with both binary genders, with a third
	identity, or an identity which can change over time.

	Some of the more common identities under the nonbinary umbrella include:
     Agender, also called genderless or non-gendered, means having no gender identity.
     Androgyne (from Greek, meaning "man-woman") and has been used for many kinds of people who
	don't fit into the gender binary. Even a century ago, some people who called themselves androgynes
	saw themselves as a mix of male and female.
     Bigender people feel they have two genders at the same time, or moving back and forth between
	them at different times.
     Genderfluid people move between different gender identities, and sometimes expressions, at
	different times.
     Gender neutral or neutrois can mean being genderless, or it can mean having a gender identity
	that is not female, not male, and not a mix, but simply neutral.
     Genderqueer: Any gender identity or expression which is queer, in and of itself. That is, a
	gender which is transgressive and non-normative. This can be an umbrella term, or a specific
	identity. The word comes from 1995.

	<summary>Why am I being asked this question?</summary>
	Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with a person's assigned sex or can differ from it. In most individuals, the various biological determinants of sex are congruent and consistent with the individual's gender identity. Gender expression typically reflects a person's gender identity, but this is not always the case. While a person may express behaviors, attitudes, and appearances consistent with a particular gender role, such expression may not necessarily reflect their gender identity. The term gender identity was coined by psychiatry professor Robert J. Stoller in 1964 and popularized by psychologist John Money.<br/>
	In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes associated with males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. Some people do not identify with some, or all, of the aspects of gender associated with their biological sex; some of those people are transgender, non-binary, or genderqueer. Some societies have third gender categories.<br/>
	The 2012 book Introduction to Behavioral Science in Medicine says that with exceptions, "Gender identity develops surprisingly rapidly in the early childhood years, and in the majority of instances appears to become at least partially irreversible by the age of 3 or 4". The Endocrine Society has stated "Considerable scientific evidence has emerged demonstrating a durable biological element underlying gender identity. Individuals may make choices due to other factors in their lives, but there do not seem to be external forces that genuinely cause individuals to change gender identity." Social constructivists argue that gender identity, or the way it is expressed, are socially constructed, determined by cultural and social influences. Constructivism of this type is not necessarily incompatible with the existence of an innate gender identity, since it may be the expression of that gender that varies by culture.

	<summary>Why am I being asked this question?</summary>
	Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100.
	If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:<br/>
	<ul>
	<li>The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.</li>
	<li>The fifth would pay $1.</li>
	<li>The sixth would pay $3.</li>
	<li>The seventh would pay $7.</li>
	<li>The eighth would pay $12.</li>
	<li>The ninth would pay $18.</li>
	<li>The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.</li>
	</ul>
	So, that's what they decided to do.<br/>
	The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve.
	'Since you are all such good customers,' he said, 'I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.' Drinks for the ten now cost just $80.<br/>
	The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected.
	They would still drink for free.
	But what about the other six men - the paying customers?
	How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share?'<br/>
	They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33.
	But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink their beer.<br/>
	So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.
	And so:
	<ul>
	<li>The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).</li>
	<li>The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).</li>
	<li>The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).</li>
	<li>The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).</li>
	<li>The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).</li>
	<li>The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).</li>
	</ul>
	Each of the six was better off than before.
	And the first four continued to drink for free.
	But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.<br/>
	'I only got a dollar out of the $20,' declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man, 'but he got $10!'<br/>
	'Yeah, that's right,' exclaimed the fifth man. 'I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than I got!'<br/>
	'That's true!!' shouted the seventh man. 'Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!'<br/>
	'Wait a minute,' yelled the first four men in unison. 'We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!'<br/>
	The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.
	The next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks so the nine sat down and had beers without him.
	But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important.
	They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!<br/>
	And that, ladies and gentlemen, politicians, journalists and think tank professors, is how our tax system works!!
	The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction.
	Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore.
	In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.<br/>
	If you want a free copy of this parable simply click the download button to the right.<br/>
	The author of this quizz disagrees with this story.
	Rich people evading taxes by moving out is in fact a politically manipulative empty threat used by rich people to avoid taxation.
	Several things are wrong in this story.
	First the richest man would pay about $10 because all the beer they drink would belong to their
	beer import company which provides the bar in the first place.
	This beer import company barely makes a profit because it bought the beer at a premium from a company still belonging to the richest man but located in a tax haven.
	Part of the $10 come in part from the profit made by the beer company in the tax haven buying it for cheap from low wage workers in another country (therefore doesn't even benefit the 9 other men).
	Another part of these $10 comes from the rent paid by the four poorest men.
	The last part comes from the interest paid by the bartender on the mortgage he had to take to acquire the pub and all the furniture in it.
	All of this money obviously makes up more than $10 which is why the richest man can get away with never working a job, and loosing money owning all the media to instigate conflict between the 9 other men as a distraction from real solution to the problem of his ever growing share of owning litterally everything at the expense of the others.
