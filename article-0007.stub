The multiverse trope is the idea of the simultaneous existence of an infinite amount of parallel universes.
This trope is related to but different from the multiple reality trope and multiple universes trope.
While these other tropes are old, the multiverse trope is a modern invention.
The multiverse is inspired by the many-world interpretation of quantum theory and the multiverse concept in string theory.

<h4>What caracterises the multiverse trope.</h4>
<p>
<!-- TODO -->
An infinite amount of universes that usually do not communicate, and especially with separated causality lines, but they may be linked using a specific piece of technology.
The idea that this infinite amount of universe means that every imaginable variation of the universe exists.
