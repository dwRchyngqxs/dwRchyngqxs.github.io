<p>
The purpose of language is often said to be communication.
This communication can have the purpose of transmitting information.
And this transmission of information that can have purpose or not, here we will focus on sharing ideas.
Because of this transmission of ideas power, people think many things about language, and many wrong things.

<h3></h3>
<p>
Our first misconception is that transmission of information is the only purpose of language.
This is not true: manipulation, wasting time, annoying people, getting them to laugh, making undeciferable alliteration.
Just like lifting is not communication, saying "how many woodchuck can a woodchuck chuck?" is no more than a speaking exercise.

One of them is that language shapes what people can think about concepts.
This idea is fundamentally wrong, otherwise how could new words and concepts ever emerge?
Another is that language carries culture, meanings, significance that shouldn't change or be lost.
While language do carry cultural elements, old meanings and antiquated ways of thinking, we shouldn't use that as an excuse to fix the use of the words to these old conceptions and prevent its associated concept from evolving.
People believing that old meaning of words still matter haven't really considered this idea thoroughly because if they did they would consider citizens only white mans living in cities.
These people should stop annoying the shit out of other people when the current meaning of a world is used by telling that:
the words they used do not mean it's current meaning,
in fact they shouldn't use it unless it is the old meaning,
what they were in fact saying is something involving the old meaning.
Meaning evolve with the use and the person the meaning that should not be associated to the world is any older meaning because it is confusing, elitist and requires people know all the old meaning of all worlds, which no one does.
When the old meaning is to be used, instead of saying the word, a paraphrase should be used.
Yet another misconception is that language shapes people, culture, and the way we see the world.
One key article is often cited with this affirmation, an article about describing a key or a table in different languages; this article couldn't be replicated so it should be considered bad and it's results meaningless.
Even if its conclusion were correct what is happening in reality is that culture, all speakers of a language and the way they see the world is in fact what influences language, not the other way around.

One final misconception that is the motivating point of this article --not that other point are secondary, less important or uninteresting, see below-- is that ideas should be communicated in a structured, organised and hierarchiced way.
We are taught to construct consistent argumentations, to hierarchize our points with structural connectors, if we present THE opposite point of view then we should contrast and tackle all presented points and all the fuss.
This is bullshit, it goes against communicating an opinion in it's entirety because it's not how we make our opinion on things.
Firstly there is often not ONE opposite point of view, but a whole spectrum of varyingly incompatible ideas each going mostly in it's own direction.
Secondly, to make our opinions we use contradicting information and have inconsistencies in our thoughts and beliefs and it's fine to communicate them.
No one is ever right in their opinion unless backed-up by meta analyses, nobody does the work of
finding research publications unless for science communication, in which case it's no longer
expressed as an opinion.
This wrongness should not be a reason to not express our opinions, we are allowed to do it and be
wrong and want to learn.
Having a built argument makes this more complicated as a contradiction can destroy whole pans of an
argumentation.
When so much effort has been put into building something, the human cognition makes it difficult to
change opinion.
But the whole preceding paragraph is assuming the person sharin its opinion want to be corrected,
which is not always the case as sharing our ideas out loud can help think on them.
This last property of sharing opinions is one that is often attributed to the method of well built
argument, however the radicalisation is less pregnant without doing so.
<!-- TODO: restructure, especially put 5 as 3 in the above paragraph -->

Most ideas are not in a state allowing to make such a structure, and most ideas are not fixed in time.
It's best to use the latest version of an idea to build on.
Thirdly some ideas are just not suited to being structured that way because there is no single consitency thread, but rather an accumulation of elements getting to one or several mostly consistent endpoints.
Fourthly understanding complex ideas is helped by building better and better approximations.
Approximations by definition are wrong on some aspects, and better approximation correct some of these aspects so contradiction between each successive approximation is unavoidable.
Fifthly it encourages people having strong fixed opinions and an unjustified confidence in them, which is the opposite of critical thinking.
All in all a perceived lack of structure shouldn't be used to criticize points instead of criticizing the points in themselves, especially if there was a structure but the listener did not get it, or worse did not bother getting it and just made a strawman to not consider your point.
