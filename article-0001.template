A three by three is a concept I saw in the Japanese animation community.
The concept is simple: Nine cells organised without order in a three by three grid, each cell is a show.
It is used to communicate one's taste in Japanese animation, not by putting all the preferred shows in, but rather by displaying the top shows in a variety of genres.
It is a useful tool to prevent the hour long conversation about someone Japanese animation taste that inevitably follows the question "I heard you like anime, what kind of anime do you like?".<br/>
I wanted to adapt this format for all cultural domains.
